text-generator is a project for my first programming class, where I've started my journey with nlp and used Markov chains to make a simple text generator with a GUI

having a possibility to interact with users graphically even in my first project was important to me, since I'm an enthusiast of Human-Computer Interaction and graphic design

I've used some tutorials on the Internet and nltk book a lot

you need to install the nltk library and download the gutenberg library 

hope you like it :]
