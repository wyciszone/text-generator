# text-generator is a project for my first programming class, where I've started my journey with nlp and used Markov chains to make a simple text generator with a GUI
# having a possibility to interact with a user even in my first project was important to me since I'm an enthusiast of Human-Computer Interaction
# I've used some tutorials on the Internet and nltk book a lot
# hope you like it :]
